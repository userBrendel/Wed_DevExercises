<p> I'm creating this bonus webpage as my way to practice and study. But also, this is going to be my sort of study guide!
     I'm trying to learn how "pre" and "class" tags work. Don't mind me just experimenting! By the way, this is my HTML file! 
     You can check my CSS too on my Github! I should try my best to make this webpage look as good as possible. This work will include.  

<!--Using pre and class tags--> 
<!--putting a different id on my p tag so i can style it differently-->    
<p id="p1">It is said that i should use the tag "pre" and "class" in my HTML file. Here it is:</p>     
<div class="section"> <!--The class property for an HTML element defines one or more class names.-->
    <!--pre tag is a preformatted content that is to be presented precisely as it is written in the HTML file-->
    <pre>
     
        
        im
           Using 
               pre
                  tags


    </pre>

im
   not 
      Using
          pre 
            tags
                                   
</div>

<!--Paragraph to explain some difference!-->
<p id ="p2">Im still a little confuse of how class works! It seems simillar to Id tags. 
    But one difference i can tell is that when we style it on our CSS file, we use (.) not (#).
    But according to my reasearch, it also differs because the "class" selector can be applied to many items 
    but the "id" selector is specific to a page and can only apply to one element at a time. </p>
